Assignment 1:
Create a method that returns true if a string contains curly braces that are balanced, and false if
the string contains an unbalanced configuration of curly braces. MUST USE STACK IN THE
IMPLEMENTATION.

Assignment 2:
Create a method that returns true if a string is a palindrome by the strict definition and false
